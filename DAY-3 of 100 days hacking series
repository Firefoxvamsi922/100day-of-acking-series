🔐 Day 3 – Types of Hackers

On Day 3 of my 100 Days of Ethical Hacking journey, I learned about the different types of hackers based on their intentions and actions.

Hackers are commonly classified into:

White Hat Hackers – Ethical hackers who work legally to secure systems

Black Hat Hackers – Attack systems illegally for personal gain

Gray Hat Hackers – Operate between ethical and unethical practices

Understanding these categories helps build the right mindset before learning tools and techniques in ethical hacking.
