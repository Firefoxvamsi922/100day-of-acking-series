Day 11 of my 100 Days of Ethical Hacking.

Today I started learning about information gathering.

Information gathering is the first step in ethical hacking.

I learned that there are two types of information gathering.

The first is Passive Information Gathering,
where information is collected without directly interacting with the target.

The second is Active Information Gathering,
where information is collected by directly interacting with the target system.

Understanding these types helps in learning ethical hacking responsibly.

Still learning. Follow for Day 12.
