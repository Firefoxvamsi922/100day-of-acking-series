🔐 Day 7 – Ports & Protocols

Today I learned about ports and protocols, which are fundamental concepts in computer networking.

Protocols define the rules that devices follow to communicate with each other,
while ports are numerical identifiers used to specify services running on a system (for example, HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443).

Understanding ports and protocols helps in analyzing how data flows across networks and is an important foundation for cybersecurity and ethical hacking.
