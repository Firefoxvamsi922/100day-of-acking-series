🔐 Day 8/100 – IP Address & MAC Address

Today I learned about IP addresses and MAC addresses in networking.

An IP address helps identify a device on a network,
while a MAC address is a unique hardware identifier assigned to the device.

Both work together to enable communication between devices on a network.
Still learning, step by step. 🚀

📌 Day 9 tomorrow.
